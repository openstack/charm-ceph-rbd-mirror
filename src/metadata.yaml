summary: Highly scalable distributed storage - Ceph RBD Mirroring
maintainer: OpenStack Charmers <openstack-charmers@lists.ubuntu.com>
description: |
  RBD images can be asynchronously mirrored between two Ceph clusters. This
  capability uses the RBD journaling image feature to ensure crash-consistent
  replication between clusters. The charm automatically creates pools used for
  RBD images on the remote cluster and configures mirroring.  Pools tagged with
  the ``rbd`` application are selected.

  NOTE: The charm requires Ceph Luminous or later.
