summary: Highly scalable distributed storage - Ceph RBD Mirroring
maintainer: OpenStack Charmers <openstack-charmers@lists.ubuntu.com>
description: |
  RBD images can be asynchronously mirrored between two Ceph clusters. This
  capability uses the RBD journaling image feature to ensure crash-consistent
  replication between clusters. Mirroring is configured on a per-pool basis
  within peer clusters and can be configured to automatically mirror all images
  within a pool or only a specific subset of images. Mirroring is configured
  using the rbd command. The rbd-mirror daemon is responsible for pulling image
  updates from the remote, peer cluster and applying them to the image within
  the local cluster.

  Note: The charm requires Ceph Luminous or later and will only support
  mirror configuration for whole pools.
